# Spaceboard

Pinterest for Notes.

## Inspiration

Inspired by [thesephist/thingboard](https://github.com/thesephist/thingboard).

Main differences:

1. people usually don't want to overlap notes, and waste a lot of time rearranging to not overlap
2. focusing on notes/bringing to top is too hard
3. Built with React/Next.js :)
4. Support markdown
5. drag+drop images/files?
6. use `localforage` for consistent storage mediums
7. eventually support sharing links...

## TODO:

- use `@theme-ui/presets`, `@theme-ui/typography`, `@theme-ui/prism`, `@theme-ui/color`, `@theme-ui/mdx`

## Dev

```bash
yarn create next-app --example with-typescript
yarn
